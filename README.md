# Simulate Regional Rainfall by using MPAS model
**What is MPAS**<br />
MPAS is abbreviation of the Model for Prediction Across Scales<br />
- A model for climate, regional climate and weather studies
- Develop atmosphere, ocean and other eath -system simulation components
- Feature in Voronoi meshes and C-grid discretization

**What is the "big" problemï¼Ÿ**<br />
Learning how to use MPAS model to process regional precipitation<br />
**Related to CSCI596**<br />
- The model envovles MPI programing
- The model running is based on GPU which is possible to accelerate the program <br />
**Goal**<br />
Can Produce a reasonable regional precipitation field<br />
