# Simulate Regional Rainfall by using WRF model
**What is WRF**<br />
WRF is abbreviation of WEATHER RESEARCH AND FORECASTING MODEL<br />
- A model for climate, regional climate and weather studies
- Develop atmosphere, ocean and other eath -system simulation components

**What is the "big" problemï¼Ÿ**<br />
How is regional precipitation in next month<br />

**Related to CSCI596**<br />
- The model envovles MPI programing
- The model running is based on GPU which is possible to accelerate the program <br />

**Source**<br />
From Los Alamos National Laboratory (COSIM) which is located in New Mexcio state<br />

**Goal**<br />
Can Produce a reasonable regional precipitation field<br />
